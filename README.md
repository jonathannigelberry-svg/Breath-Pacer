# Relaxation Breath Pacer

A minimal, research-inspired **breath-pacing timer** that guides the user through  
an evidence-based **1 : 2 breathing ratio** (inhale → hold → exhale → hold)  
shown to aid relaxation and autonomic balance.

## How it works
1. **Press and hold** the centre circle for your full in-breath.  
2. On release, the timer automatically:
   - Holds for ≈ 1.5 s  
   - Times the out-breath = 2 × inhale duration  
   - Holds again ≈ 1.5 s  
3. Every breath is different and so each breath cycle you repeat the process of holding the button.

Longer exhalations activate the **parasympathetic (“rest and digest”)** system,  
supporting calm focus and lower stress responses.

## Scientific background
Modern research supports longer-exhale breathing for mood and physiological calm:

- **Balban Y. et al., 2023.** *Cell Reports Medicine.*  
  “Brief structured respiration practices enhance mood and reduce physiological arousal.”  
  [PMCID: PMC9873947](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9873947/)

- **Zaccaro A. et al., 2018.** *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience.*  
  “How breath control can change your life: A systematic review.”  
  [DOI: 10.3389/fnhum.2018.00353](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2018.00353)

- **Telles S. et al., 2017.** *Applied Psychophysiology & Biofeedback.*  
  “Effect of yogic breathing with 1 : 2 ratio on autonomic balance.”  

Together these studies show that **exhale-emphasised breathing**  
increases vagal tone and promotes relaxation.

## Disclaimer
This breathing timer is intended for **relaxation and stress-reduction only**.  
It is **not a medical device** and does **not diagnose, treat, or prevent disease**.  
Users with **any health condition or medical concern** should consult  
a qualified healthcare professional before practising breath-control.  
Stop immediately if you feel dizzy, light-headed, or unwell.  
Research supports slower, longer-exhale breathing for calm,  
but individual responses vary.
